# Smart Calculator with Machine Learning

## Project Overview
A Python application that combines a basic calculator with machine learning to predict future expenses. It performs arithmetic operations and uses Linear Regression to forecast expenses based on historical data.

## Features
- Basic arithmetic: add, subtract, multiply, divide
- Calculate total expense over months
- Predict future expense using a trained ML model

## Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn (Linear Regression)

## How to Use
1. Run `calculator.py`
2. Choose between basic calculator, expense calculation, or prediction
3. Follow prompts to enter inputs

## Data
Historical expense data is stored in `data.csv` and used to train the ML model.
